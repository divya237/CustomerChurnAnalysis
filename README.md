# Customer Churn Analysis

### **Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The analysis provides key insights into churned customers, highlights patterns and trends, and predicts the likelihood of customer churn using machine learning techniques.

### **Objective**  
The primary objectives of this project are to:  
- Identify factors contributing to customer churn.  
- Provide a detailed analysis of churned customers through visualizations.  
- Predict the probability of churn for each customer using machine learning models.  

### **Key Insights**  
1. **Customer Trends:**  
   - Majority of churned customers fall under specific demographics (e.g., tenure, region, or service type).  
   - Contract type and customer service interactions heavily influence churn rates.  

2. **Machine Learning Predictions:**  
   - A machine learning algorithm was used to predict churn probabilities.  
   - Customers with high churn probabilities were identified for retention strategies.
   - 
### **Tools and Technologies**  
- **Power BI:** For visualization and dashboard creation.  
- **Excel:** Used for initial data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- **Python/ML Algorithm:** Used to train and apply a machine learning model to predict churn probabilities.  

### **Dataset:** C:\Users\divya chauhan\Desktop\Excel_dataset\Telco Customer Churn.csv
### **Predicted Dataset:** C:\Users\divya chauhan\Desktop\Excel_dataset\Telco_Customer_Churn_Predictions.csv

### **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled null values and outliers in Excel.  
   - Standardized column names and ensured appropriate data types.  

2. **Data Analysis:**  
   - Visualized churn trends by demographics, tenure, and subscription types in Power BI.  
   - Identified key factors contributing to churn.  

3. **Machine Learning Model:**  
   - Used Python to train a machine learning model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) on customer data.  
   - Generated churn probabilities for each customer.  

4. **Dashboard Creation:**  
   - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers and detailed visuals to explore churn trends and predictions.
